           <p> Mobile photography has been an upcoming hobby for alot of individuals and phoographers alike.
               For as long as phones have had cameras people have been using their phones to capture
               everyday and create art through the lense of their phones. However in the recent years
               phones have been increasing in camera technology and versability and we'll go over all of it in this page.

            Most mobile phones for the past few years have been using 12mp camera sensors with a low aperature that didnt let in much light.
            This was done because the cameras on phones werent a main focus at all when it came down the the device. However with companies like smasung, xiaomi, huaweii,
            and now even google have been upgrading their camera hard ware to include nearly 1inch sensors in their phones with megapixel ranges from 50 all the way up 
            to 108 megapixels. Now most people will ask why would anyone want a camera with such a high mp count on their phone? Well photography is a growning hobby day by day 
            and the technology needed to pull off 108mp in a smartphone(even though it would be more impressive and more detailed) is impressive and provides unmatched
            detail when it comes to smarphone photos. Not just the 108mp lense on some phones but the same goes to the 50mp lenses on other phones as well. The larger sensor allows 
            for more light to come in letting phones have incredible night mode performance. Creating images with less noise and more visbale detail. Also the high mp count 
            allows for mobile photograhpers to print out the image in high end quality with more detail than a normal smartphone. However not every company relies on big mp
            counts others rely on computational features. But first lets get into the camera hard ware that solves the problems with have a big wide open sensor.

                On to mobile camera hardware advancments beyond what we just went over. So as i went over before hand alot of cellphone manufactuers have been making 
                huge camera sensors to put inside of their phones. However the downside to those senors is that the f-stop on those sensors are always open. With the f-stop always 
                open it lets in alot of light that makes the night shots great. Also it gives a natural bokeh(blur in the background of the image seperate from the foreground)
                which creates a real professional look because thats what a full size dslr does because of the size of the lense and the senor. However the downside at this size is the auto
                focus and the fringing that happens with the images. All of the phones have the same similar problem were the photos sometimes end up being out of focus(this problem has been 
                solved by most companies with laser autofocus or better sensors) or the edges of the photos have fringing and the edges of objects in the photo arent in focus and seperated from
                the background properly. This is solved in sonys newest phone the pro 1-i which has variable aperature. This feature works just like an actual camera where you can change the aperature 
                of the camera and close the f-stop to let in less light. This ends up fixing the problem with having a huge sensor in these smartphones since with closing the aperature can help focus
                the lense on the image and seperate the foreground and background properly. This feature comes with down sides like a lost in low light quality because the aperature isnt open as wide.
                However this feature is still needed in this time with the hardware being used.(Sony isnt the first and only company to do this samsung did this feature first and included it in the s9 
                and s10 series, images can be found in the gallery tab.)

               Now that we are all aware of insane camera hardware that companies are doing. We can now talk about the other side of the spectrum with mobile photography.Companies use post processing 
               and computation to increase the quality of their photos. However google and apple for years only focused on software and computation to such an extent that they where at the top of everyone
               lists for best smartphone cameras every year. So a company can make their smartphones photo quality match that of ones with better hardware using only software. Computational photography is such an
               important piece of software technology that when used together it can create amazing photos and videos out of a smartphone camera.
